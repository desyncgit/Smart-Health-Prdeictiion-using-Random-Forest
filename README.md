#The Training and Testing dataset are needed to be moved to a folder named "Dataset", make sure the folder is in the same location as app.py
#also move the .joblib file to the folder "saved_model" that needs to be created at the same location as app.py

#to avoid doing the above steps simply make changes to the config.yaml file where the paths for Training and Testing dataset is defined.

#type, "streamlit run app.py".

#the streamlit webpage should start running on the localhost
